## ✨ What Makes This Special

This isn't just a colour-swap toggle. It's a **fully animated sky scene** built entirely with CSS — no images, no SVGs from external sources, no libraries. Every cloud, star, moon, and comet is drawn in pure code.

| Feature | Detail |
|---|---|
| ☀️ Day Mode | Animated clouds drifting across a warm gradient sky |
| 🌙 Night Mode | Twinkling stars, crescent moon, and a comet streak |
| 🌙 Crescent Moon | CSS-only clean cut — no fake shadow trick |
| ⏱️ Timed Animations | Clouds and comets trigger once every 30 seconds |
| 💾 Persistent State | Theme survives page refresh via `localStorage` |
| 🚫 Zero Dependencies | No React, no libraries, no images |

## 🚀 How to Use

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

# 2. Navigate into the folder
cd your-repo-name

# 3. Open in browser — no build step needed
open index.html
```

That's it. Zero config. Zero installs.

## 🧠 Key Technical Highlights

**CSS-only crescent moon** — achieved with `border-radius` and `box-shadow`, not two overlapping circles.

**Comet animation** — uses a skewed pseudo-element with a gradient tail, timed with `setInterval` in JS.

**Theme persistence** — `localStorage.getItem('theme')` on load applies the saved preference before the first paint, preventing flash.

**Animation orchestration** — `setInterval` drives cloud and comet triggers every 30 seconds; CSS `animation-play-state` toggles individual elements on/off cleanly.

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Portfolio projects & UI/UX demos
- Design system component libraries
- Front-end interview take-home challenges
- Learning CSS animations & JS state management

---

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- [ ] Convert to reusable React / Vue component
- [ ] Add ARIA labels & full keyboard accessibility
- [ ] Auto-detect system dark mode preference (`prefers-color-scheme`)
- [ ] Multiple parallax cloud layers for added depth
- [ ] Sunrise / sunset transition animation

## 🌗 Day/Night Theme Toggle — Vanilla JS UI Component

**Animated day/night toggle built with zero dependencies** — pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Demonstrates:
- Advanced CSS animation techniques (keyframes, timing functions, pseudo-elements)
- DOM state management without a framework
- Persistent UI state via `localStorage`
- Clean component architecture that's portable to any stack

> 💡 **Why this matters in interviews:** Most candidates reach for React for a toggle. This shows you understand the DOM, CSS rendering, and browser APIs at a foundational level — skills that make you effective in *any* framework.

**Stack:** `HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` — No frameworks, no libraries, no build tools

**Option A — Story-driven (higher engagement)**

---

I built a day/night theme toggle.

No React. No libraries. No images.

Just HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Here's what's inside:

→ CSS-only crescent moon (no fake shadow trick — a real geometric cut)
→ Twinkling stars with staggered CSS keyframes
→ A comet that streaks across the sky every 30 seconds
→ Animated clouds drifting through a warm daytime gradient
→ Theme state that persists across page refreshes using localStorage

The whole thing is a single index.html file.

I built this to go back to fundamentals — and remind myself that you don't need a framework to ship something polished.

Sometimes a deep understanding of the basics is the most impressive thing you can show.
